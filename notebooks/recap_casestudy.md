#### **Knockout mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS)**
-   It is a rare disease found in people​ with the folowing phenotypes:
    -   distinctive facial features​
    -   intellectual disability​
    -   cardiovascular abnormalities ​
-   It is caused by a disruption in the Gtf2ird1gene​

To improve our understanding of this disease, *Corley et al. 2016* created a knockout mouse model of this disease. ​

#### **Question asked**
Which genes (if any) are upregulated or downregulated in our knockout mice and how do these relate to the disease phenotype?​
