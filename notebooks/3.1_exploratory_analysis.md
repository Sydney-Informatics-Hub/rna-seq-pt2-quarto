# **Exploratory analysis**

<div class="objectives">  

### **Objectives**

- Perform initial exploratory analysis on the geen-count matrix
</div>  

<div class="questions">

### **Questions**
- How to perform exploratory analysis of the count-matrix?
</div>  


## **Exploratory analysis and visualization**

### **Box plot**
RNA-seq data sometimes contain isolated instances of very large counts that are apparently unrelated to the experimental or study design, and which may be considered outliers. 


- A quick look at the distribution of the data across sample using box plots.

```r
boxplot(log2((counttable)+1),las=3, col="red"){width=50%}
```

### **What is a DESeq2 object?**

- The basic entity used by the DESeq2 package is and object class called DESeqDataSet.
- The DESeqDataSet object is used to store both the read counts and the intermediate estimated quantities during statistical analysis 
- We will call this object by name 'dds' which is a standard practice (**Note** We can name this object absolutely anything in real world ðŸ™‚).
- Please see the [guide](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) for detailed information about the DESeq2 library.
- We also define a condition variable to associate the individual columns (samples) in the matrix to their appropriate experimental condition (either 'Wild-type' or 'Knockout').
- We will then prepare the DESeq2 object with `design = ~1`; 
   - A design of ~1 is used for no experimental design and is useful for exploring quality of the data (not for identifying differentially expressed -DE genes).

```r
# Define a condition variable 
condition=c("Wild","Wild","Wild","KO","KO","KO")
meta <- data.frame(row.names=colnames(counttable),condition)
View(meta)


```r
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counttable, 
       colData = meta, 
       design = ~1)
```

### **Data transformations**

- For visualization or clustering it is useful to work with transformed versions of the count data.
- The two most common choices of transformation used for this purpose are -
   - Variance stabilizing transformation (vst)
   - Regularized log transformation (rlog)
- These algorithms transform the raw count data (which is heteroskedatic - variance grows with the mean) into homoskedatic data (variance is not dependant on the mean). 
- Both methods produce data on the log2 scale, and normalize for other factors such as library size. Setting `blind=TRUE` (the default) should be used to compare samples in a manner wholly unbiased about the information about experimental groups, for example to perform sample QC. 

- **Note** : In order to test for differential expression, we operate on raw counts (and not normalized/transformed counts).


### **Variance stabilisting transformation (VST)**
- VST by default uses a subset of 1000 rows to estimate the dispersion trend. 
- This method is much faster than the other transformation mathod called - rlog.
- Hence, VST is recommended if you have hundreds of samples.

```r
vst <- vst(dds, blind = TRUE)
vst.data <- assay(vst)

# 
# Regularized log (rlog) takes a long time with 50 or more samples
# rld <- rlog(dds, blind=FALSE)

```


### **Re-drawing the box plots**

- We will now re-generate the box plots to see if the transformation has brought about any difference in distribution.

```r
boxplot(vst.data,las=3, col="red")
```

<div class="challenge">

### **Challenge #1**

Looking at the above two box plots:

- Do you see a difference in the two box plots (before and after transformation)?
- Do you think the transformation has helped?

### **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

- PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique. It extracts information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. Here dimensions are the features (all your thousands of genes from the genome) which represent the data and explain most of the variability.
- PCA preserves the essential parts that have more variation of the data and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.
- This plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects.
- Ideally, in your experiment, the most of the variability is explained by the conditions (e.g. WT versus KO in this case). If any of the samples group differently, the DE analysis cannot be relied upon. 
- If we have big number of replicate samples, PCA allows you to identify and remove (if required) any outliers.

```r
plotPCA(vst)
```

### **Challenge #3**

- Looking at just the PCA, can you guess which samples belong to which conditions?
- Why?

```r
plotPCA(vst)+ theme(legend.position = "none")

### **Why choose best the dimension? **  :grinning:

![](/fig/Prince_William_dimensionality.png){width=50%} 


  
### **A Scree plot can assist**

- The Principal Component matrix has the same dimensions as the original data matrix; however, many of the PCs may not be informative. A reduction in the number of PCs is typically required. 
- To do so, it is useful to examine the amount of variance explained by each new PC vector.
- A scree plot is a line plot of the principal components in an analysis. 
  - The scree plot is used to determine the number of principal components to keep in a principal component analysis (PCA).
  - It shows the eigenvalues on the y-axis and the number of factors on the x-axis and it always displays a downward curve.
  - The point where the slope of the curve is clearly leveling off (the "elbow) indicates the number of factors that should be generated by the analysis.
  - Let's draw a scree plot.
  
```r
pca=prcomp(t(assay(vst)),scale=FALSE)
options(repr.plot.width=0.5, repr.plot.height=0.5)
fviz_eig(pca, addlabels = TRUE)
```


![](/fig/scree_plot.png) 
  
We can see that PC1 followed by PC2 have captured most of the variance.

### **Small contributions of many genes to variation**
It is observed that in biological experiments multiple genes contribute to the the principle compoments in a small way. This can be seen in the plot below where the Y-axis shows the small % contributions of multiple genes to PC1

```r
# The function fviz_contrib() [in factoextra package] is used 
# to visualize the contributions of rows/columns from the 
# results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
fviz_contrib(pca, choice = "var", axes = 1, top = 100)
```

### **Heatmap (Sample-to-sample distances)**

- A heatmap of a distance matrix gives us an overview over similarities and dissimilarities between samples. 
- We have to provide a hierarchical clustering hc to the heatmap function based on the sample distances.

```r
sampleDists <- dist(t(assay(vst)))
sampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists)
rownames(sampleDistMatrix) <- paste(vst$condition, vst$type, sep="-")
colnames(sampleDistMatrix) <- NULL
colors <- colorRampPalette( rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")) )(255)
pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,
         clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists,
         clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists,
         col=colors)
```
![Heatmap to view distances between samples](/fig/Heatmap_sample_distances.png) 



<div class="challenge">

### **Challenge #2**

Does the heatmap convey information about the samples and the two conditions?


<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- The WT samples cluster together.
- One of the KO samples is a bit distant to it's replicates.

<div class="keypoints">
### **Key points**
-   Exploratory analysis such as heatmap based clustering, PCA and scree-plots etc can help us get an initial understanding of the data and if the experimental variability is explained by the conditions of interest.
-   It can also help to identify and avoid possible outlier samples from the experiment.
