- Start RStudio server on the Pawsey Nimbus Vm instance

### **Identifying differentially exoressed (DE) genes**
- Importing the read-count matrix in R
- Pre-processing steps
- Multivariate analysis (PCA plots etc)
- Generate DE genes


### **Functional enrichment anaylsis**

### **Key points**
- We will work in the R environment using RStudio to identify DE genes from the count matix 
- The list of DE gene will be used to identify functional enrichments.
