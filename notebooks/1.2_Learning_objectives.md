<div class="questions">
### **Questions**
- What is R/RStudio?
- How to start a RStudio environment on the Pawsey Nimbus training-VM?
- How to identify differentially expressed genes using the gene-count matrix in R?
- How to do functional enrichment in R?
</div>

<div class="objectives">
### **Objectives**
- Quick overview of the primary learning objectives

</div>  

### **R/RStudio for downstream analysis**
- Introduction to R
- Introduction to RStudio
- Start RStudio server on the Pawsey Nimbus Vm instance

### **Identifying differentially exoressed (DE) genes**
- Importing the read-count matrix in R
- Pre-processing steps
- Multivariate analysis (PCA plots etc)
- Generate DE genes


### **Functional enrichment anaylsis**
- What is gene ontology?
- What is enrichment analysis?
- How to perform functional enrichment analysis in R? 

##### **Notes**

<sup id="f1">1[â†©](#a1)</sup> Here is a list of ['nfcore pipelines'](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/).

<div class="keypoints">
### **Key points**
- We will work in the R environment using RStudio to identify DE genes from the count matix 
- The list of DE gene will be used to identify functional enrichments.
