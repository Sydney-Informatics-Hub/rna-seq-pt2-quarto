# **Day 2: Learning objectives**

Today we will use analysis ready rgen-count data generated in part 1 of the series to perform differential expression and pathway analysis

### **Setting up R/RStudio on Pawsey Nimbus**
- Start R/RStudio on the Pawsey Nimbus
- Learn how to import the read-count matrix in R/RStudio

### **Exploratory analysis**
- Learn how to perform exploratory analysis 
- Learn about principal component analysis (PCA)
- Learn how to check the quality of the data and experimental design

### **Identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes**
- Become familiar with DESeq2
- Create and understand the DESeq2 dataset object
=======
# **Learning objectives**


### **R/RStudio for downstream analysis**
- Introduction to R
- Introduction to RStudio
- Start RStudio server on the Pawsey Nimbus Vm instance

### **Identifying differentially exoressed (DE) genes**
- Importing the read-count matrix in R
- Pre-processing steps
- Multivariate analysis (PCA plots etc)
>>>>>>> 4cfd9dbe97903ee36f00a2e4cad24890490a6c86
- Generate DE genes
- Visualise the DE genes


### **Functional enrichment anaylsis**
- Understand and perform gene ontology enrichement analysis
- Understand and perform pathway enrichment analysis
- Visualise enriched gene ontologies and pathways

##### **Notes**

### **Key points**
- We will work in the R environment using RStudio to identify DE genes from the count matix 
- The list of DE gene will be used to identify functional enrichments.
