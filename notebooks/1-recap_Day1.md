### Objectives
- Recap Day 1: nfcore-rnaseq pipeline
</div>  

![nfcore-rnaseq workflow](../fig/typical_and_nfcore_merged.png)


-   What is RNA sequencing and what are the main applications of RNA-seq?
-   What are the typical steps in a RNA-seq differential expression analysis pipeline?
-   Why do we require workflow managers such as nextflow for bioinformatics pipelines?
-   How to run the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline on the Pawsey Nimbus VM?
-   What are the important features of the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline?
-   What to do next; using the gene-count matrix?




#### Notes

<sup id="f1">1[â†©](#a1)</sup> Here is a list of ['nfcore pipelines'](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/).

### Key points

- We generated a gene-count matrix using the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline, using a single command.
- The gene-count matrix will be used today for identifying differentially expressed genes.
