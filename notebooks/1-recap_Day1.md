### **Objectives**
- **Recap Day 1:** nf-core/rnaseq pipeline
</div>  

![](../fig/nfcore_whatNext.png)


-   What is RNA sequencing and what are the main applications of RNA-seq?
-   What are the typical steps in a RNA-seq differential expression analysis pipeline?
-   Why do we require workflow managers such as nextflow for bioinformatics pipelines?
-   How to run the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline on the Pawsey Nimbus VM?
-   What are the important features of the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline?
-   What to do next; using the gene-count matrix?




#### **Notes**

<sup id="f1">1[â†©](#a1)</sup> Here is a list of ['nf-core/rnaseq'](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/).



<div class="keypoints">

### **Key points**

- We generated a gene-count matrix using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, using a single command.
- The gene-count matrix will be used today for identifying differentially expressed genes.
