## **Synopsis**{.unlisted}

In **part 2** of this workshop series, participants will use raw gene count data generated in [part 1](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.RNAseq.series/) to perform downstream analysis of RNA-seq data using R/Rstudio, including how to analyse **raw count data to obtain differentially expressed genes and pathways**. We will be working on **[Pawsey's Nimbus Cloud](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Cloud+Documentation)** platform.

## **Target audience**{.unlisted}

This workshop series is suitable for people who are familiar with working at command line interface and may be new to RNA-seq for differential expression analysis. The course is beginner friendly and intended for those interested in using the command line interface for their analysis. It is also suitable for those who want to learn about and use nf-co.re workflows.

## **How to navigate the web pages** {.unlisted}
Please use the Menu bar to move between lessons. We will start Day 1 with the `Setup` page and then naviate to the right. Each main menu header has sub-header which will be visible when you click on the main-menu, as shown below.
